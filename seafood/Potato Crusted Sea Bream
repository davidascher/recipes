Ingredients

3 sea bream fillets, skin on, can also use seabass
3 yellow potatoes, sliced 3-4 mm (1/8 inch) thick
3-4 rosemary twigs, needles detached and finely chopped
olive oil
salt & white pepper
Preparation


Mince the rosemary needles.
Peel and wash the potatoes.

Slice the potatoes. Use a food processor with a slicing blade, or a mandoline slicer works too. It's important that the slices are not too thin and not too thick, therefore slicing them by hand is not easy.
Allow the slices to rest on a towel and pat them dry with some paper towel.

Line the bottom and sides of a large bowl with potato slices and dress with a sprinkle of olive oil, salt, pepper, chopped rosemary.
Then add another layer of potato slices and repeat the seasoning. Continue until you've used all potato slices, then gently slide them around in the bowl to complete the seasoning. Preheat the oven at 200 C.

Put the fish fillets, skin down, on lightly oiled parchment paper, season them with salt, pepper, and rosemary.
Cover each fillet with partially overlapped potato slices. The fillets should be completely encompassed by the potato slices

Cook in the oven for 30-35 minutes at 200 C.
