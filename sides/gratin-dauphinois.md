# Madame Laracine's Gratin Dauphinois

## Ingredients

* 3 lb medium-sized russet potatoes, peeled, and sliced very thinly
* 2 cups milk
* 2 cups water
* 3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* Sea salt to taste
* 3 bay leaves
* Freshly ground nutmeg and pepper to taste
* 1 cup crème fraîche or heavy ream
* 10 oz Gruyère cheese, freshly grated

## Steps

* Preheat oven at 375 F
* Place potatoes in large saucepan and cover with milk and water. Add garlic, salt and bay leaves, and with the pan partially covered, bring to a boil over medium high heat, stirring occasionally so that the potatoes do not stick to the bottom of the pan. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring from time to time, until the potatoes are tender but not falling apart, about 10 minutes.
* Using a large, flat strainer, transfer half the potatoes to an 8 cup gratin dish. Sprinkle with nutmeg, pepper, half the cream and half the cheese. Cover with the remaining potatoes and sprinkle again with pepper, nutmeg and the remaining cream and cheese. Discard the milk, water and herb in which the potatoes were cooked.
* Bake until the gratin is crisp and golden on top, about one hour. Serve immediately.
