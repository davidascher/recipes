# Sweet Yeast Dough for cardamom/walnut buns etc.

Time: 1hour 30 minutes, Plus at least 4 hours for chilling I Difficulty: 2 (Easy
Makes enough dough for 12 large buns or 2 babkas

# Ingredients

* 1 cup whole milk (8 oz / 227g)
* 1½ teaspoons active dry yeast (0.18 oz / 5g)
* 4½ cups all-purpose flour (20.6 oz / 585g), plus more for the work surface and bowl
* ⅓ cup sugar (2.3 oz / 66g)
*  1½/ teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt (0.16 oz / 5g)
* 10 tablespoons unsalted butter (5 oz / 142g), cut into 1-inch pieces, chilled
* 3 large eggs (5.3 oz / 150g)

This is a versatile dough that can be used to make all types of sweet buns
and breads

# Steps

1. Warm the milk and proof the yeast: In a small saucepan, gently warm the
milk over low heat, swirling the pan, just until it's lukewarm to the touch but
not hot (about 105°F on an instant-read thermometer). Pour about ¼ cup of
the warm milk (2 oz / 57g) into a small bowl and whisk in the yeast until it's
dissolved. Let the yeast mixture sit until it's foamy, about 5 minutes.

1. Make the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the flour, sugar, salt,
and butter and toss to coat the butter pieces. Make a well in the center of the
bowl and pour in the eggs, yeast mixture, and remaining warm milk. Set the
bowl on the mixer and attach the dough hook. Mix on low speed until all
the flour is moistened, then increase to medium and continue to mix until
the butter is incorporated (the warm milk will soften it eventually) and you
have a soft, sticky dough, about 5 minutes. Stop the mixer, scrape down the
sides of the bowl, then mix on medium-high until the dough pulls cleanly
away from the sides, gathers almost completely around the hook, and is
very smooth and supple, about 5 minutes longer. It will still be very soft and
might start to stick to the bowl when the mixer is at a lower speed, but if the
dough sticks on medium-high then add more flour by the tablespoon until it
pulls away and is slightly tacky but no longer sticky.  *Alternatively*: mix in a bowl until
it's a wet dough, then slap and fold for 10 minutes until tacky but no longer sticky.

1. Proof the dough and then chill: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
surface and gather it into a ball. Dust the dough all over with a bit more
flour, then place inside a medium bowl. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic
wrap and let it sit at room temperature until it's about 50 percent expanded
in size. 1 to 1½ hours. 2 Transfer the bowl to the refrigerator where the
dough will finish the first rise, eventually doubling. Chill until cold, at least
4 hours, though 8 to 12 is better (not only will refrigerating the dough make it
firmer and easier to handle, it will improve the flavor as well).
