# Mexican rolls

Good because they have a bunch of oil in them

## Ingredients

* 1¼ cups warm (not hot) water
* 2 tablespoons fresh yeast, or 1 tablespoon active dry yeast
* 4 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons plus
* 1¾ teaspoons sugar
* 1 tablespoon kosher salt
* ¾ cup rice bran oil or canola oil

## Steps

1. In a large bowl, whisk the water and yeast until incorporated. Add the flour and mix with
your hands until smooth. Cover the bowl and set in a warm place to rise until doubled in
size, about 1 hour.

1. In the clean bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the sugar, salt,
and oil. Add the dough and mix on low speed until the mixture is smooth and elastic.

1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Divide the dough into 6 equal balls (about
4 ounces each). Using the palm of your hand, press each ball into an oval shape. Using
the long, thin handle of a wooden spoon, imprint two channels lengthwise into each piece,
dividing the tops of each roll into three equal sections without cutting all the way through.

1. Transfer the pieces to the prepared baking sheet and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let
rest in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

1. Preheat the oven to 375'F. Uncover the rolls and bake, rotating the pan halfway through
baking, until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely
before using or storing. Wrap in plastic wrap or store in a resealable plastic bag. Use within
3 to 4 days fresh, or freeze.
