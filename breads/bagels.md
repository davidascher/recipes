# Ingredients

## Dough
* 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast or instant yeast
* 2 cups lukewarm water
* 1/4 cup (35g) malted milk powder or non-diastatic malt powder
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 18g salt
* 690g All-Purpose Flour

## Water Bath
* 2 quarts (1814g) water
* 2 tablespoons (18g) malted milk powder or non-diastatic malt powder
* 1 tablespoon (14g) sugar

# Steps

1. To make the dough: In a large bowl, mix all of the ingredients, then knead until smooth, using your hands, an electric mixer, or a bread machine set on the dough cycle.

1. Shape the dough into a ball, place it in a lightly greased bowl covered with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow it to rise until doubled in bulk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

1. Gently deflate the dough, and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface.

1. For the water bath: Put the water into a large, shallow pan; it should be about 3" deep. Add the malt and sugar. Bring the water to a boil while you're shaping the bagels.

1. Preheat the oven to 425Â°F.

1. Divide the dough into 12-16 pieces. Working with one piece of dough at a time, shape it into a ball. Poke a hole through the center with your index finger, and twirl; the dough will form a ring.

1. Place the bagels on a parchment-lined baking sheet as they're shaped.

1. Once all the bagels are shaped, reduce the boiling water bath to a very gentle simmer. Starting with the first bagels you shaped, gently transfer 3 or 4 at a time to the water bath; don't crowd them. Simmer them for about 30 seconds on each side, then return them to the baking sheet.

1. Bake the bagels for 20 minutes, or until they're a deep golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and cool them on a rack.

1. Serve bagels warm or at room temperature. Store at room temperature, well wrapped, for several days; freeze for longer storage.
