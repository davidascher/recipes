Makes 12 buns

### Special Equipment:
13 x9-inch pan (preferably metal), stand
mixer (for the Sweet Yeast Dough)

## Ingredients
* 2 cups walnut halves or pieces (7oz/200g)
* 1/3 cup maple syrup (5.6 oz / 160g)
* Seeds scraped from 1 vanilla bean or 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* ½ cup plus ⅓ cup packed light brown sugar (5.8 oz / 165g)
* 8 tablespoons unsalted butter (4 oz / 113g)
* 1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (0.11 oz / 3g)
* 1 3/4 teaspoons ground cardamom
* 1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest
* Sweet Yeast Dough, chilled
* All-purpose flour, for rolling out

## Steps
1. Preheat the oven and toast the nuts: Arrange an oven rack in the center
position and preheat the oven to 350°F. Scatter the walnuts on a small
rimmed baking sheet and toast, shaking halfway through, until they're
golden brown and fragrant, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and
set aside to cool. Place the nuts inside a plastic bag and seal, pressing out
all the air, then bash the nuts lightly with a rolling pin to crush them into
tiny bits. Set aside. (Turn the oven off.)

1. Make the sticky topping: In a small saucepan, combine the maple syrup,
vanilla, ½ cup brown sugar, 4 tablespoons butter, and ½ teaspoon salt.
Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring often, until it comes to a boil.
Boil for about 30 seconds, then remove from the heat and pour into the
bottom of the pan (reserve the saucepan for melting more butter). Scatter
the crushed walnuts evenly over the liquid and set aside.

1. Prepare the filling: In a small bowl, combine the cardamom, orange zest,
and remaining ⅓ cup brown sugar and ½ teaspoon salt and massage with
your fingertips until the zest is worked into the sugar and the mixture
is fragrant. Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter in the reserved
saucepan over low heat. Set the butter aside to cool.

1. Roll out the dough: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and
press down on it all over with the heel of your hand to expel the built-up
gas from the first rise. Tugging at the edges to form four corners, stretch
the dough to coax it into an even, rectangular shape. Dust the top and
underside of the dough with more flour and roll it out, dusting with
more flour as needed, into a ¼-inch-thick rectangle measuring about
20 x9 inches. 

1. Form the buns: Brush the cooled, melted butter
all across the surface of the dough in an even
layer, working all the way to the edges. Scatter the
cardamom filling over the dough, rubbing it gently
into the dough with your hands so it adheres and
spreading into any bare spots so the entire surface is
covered. Starting at one of the long sides, roll up the
dough like a jelly roll into a tight spiraled log and let
it rest seam-side down on the surface. Squeeze the log
where it's a bit thicker in the center and tug outward
to elongate and even out the thickness.

1. Cut and place in the prepared pan: Use a serrated
knife to trim off a ½-inch-thick slice from each end,
revealing the spiral. Try to work quickly while the
dough is still cool and easier to slice. Cut the log in
half crosswise, then each piece in half again. Cut
each piece into thirds so you have 12 more-or-less-
equal pieces. Place each piece cut-side down in the
prepared pan on top of the walnuts, spacing evenly in
a 3 x 4 grid.

1. Second rise: Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap
and let the buns rise at room temperature until
they're about 50 percent expanded in size, 40 to
60 minutes. 

1. Meanwhile, preheat the oven: Arrange an oven rack in
the center position and preheat the oven to 350°F.
Bake and unmold: Uncover the pan and bake until the
buns are puffed and golden brown across the surface,
30 to 35 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and
let the buns rest 5 minutes. Cut between the sides of
the pan and the buns with a small offset spatula or
butter knife to loosen them, then place a wire rack
on top of the buns and invert the entire pan and rack
together in one motion-there might be hot leaking
caramel, so use caution and work over a sink if you
can. Remove the pan slowly and scrape off any nuts
that have stuck in the pan and spread them back onto
the buns. Let the buns cool on the rack. Serve warm
or at room temperature.

NB. Be careful that you don't overproof the
dough in the pan since this will produce
a harder textured bun rather than a soft,
bready one. If you wait until the buns hit
the usual indicator of "doubled in size,"
they'll be a bit too far gone. Go with the
"50 percent" indicator and trust they will
expand dramatically in the oven.
