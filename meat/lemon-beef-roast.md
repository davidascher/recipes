# Ingredients

Serves 4-6

* 1 eye round roast, about 1-1.5 kilos/2-3 lbs
* 125 ml (1/2 cup) olive oil
* 500 ml (2 cups) beef broth, preferably homemade
*2 lemons
* Salt and pepper
* Finely minced parsley (optional)

# Directions
1. Grate the zest from both lemons and reserve. Cut the lemons in half and juice them. Reserve the juice as well.
2. Season the roast generously with salt and pepper all over.
2. Over a moderate flame, heat the olive oil in an oval casserole in which the roast will fit snugly. Add the roast and brown it well on all sides. (Be aware that the roast is apt to splatter on contact, so have a lid at the ready.)
2. Pour over the lemon juice and let it evaporate, turning the roast over as it does so it is covered all over in the pan juices.
2. Once the lemon juice has evaporated, pour in the beef stock. Cover and let the roast braise until it is fork tender, about 2-1/2 to 3 hours, either over a low flame on the stove or in a low (160C/325F) oven. (With either method, adjust the temperature as needed so that the braising liquid remains at a gentle simmer.)
2. At the end of the simmering time, there should be ample, but much reduced and intensely flavored, pan juices. Taste and adjust for seasoning.
2. When the roast is just about done braising, add the lemon zest and continue uncovered for 15 minutes.
2. Remove the roast from the braising pan and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before carving it into slices and setting the slices out on a serving platter.
2. Bring the juices back to a simmer, along with the optional minced parsley if using, and nap the slices with the juices, serving the rest in a sauceboat for those who want it.
