* 2 large leeks

* 1 medium turnip
* 1 head of garlic
* 1 onion, quartered
* Chicken wings, spines, carcass, or combination of: priority is high cartilage and dark meat, low fat.

### Stock Method

Cut carrots, celery, leeks, parsnip, turnip, garlic, onion into halves to maximize surface area. The amount of different vegetable can be modified: Parsnips give a peppery taste, turnips a meaty taste, etc...\)

Brown vegetables in oven on braise.

Brown chicken parts - this takes a long time. The chicken parts should be cooked for as long as possible without burning, as long as 10 min a side.

In stock pot combine browned chicken, vegetable, a generous handful of pepper kernels \(optionally toasted in a pan\), Bouquet Garni. Fill to rim with water.

Bring to a low simmer and cook for at least 10hrs, adding water when necessary.

Skim regularly for the first 1-2 hours, removing as much scum as possible.

Strain through a chinois or through cheesecloth placed in a colander. Throw out the remains.

Let the stock cool to room temp. Skim fat and refrigerate/freeze. The stock remains fresh for at around 5 days in the fridge. Bring the stock to a boil and it can last another 5 days.
