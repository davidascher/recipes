# Sardine and Fennel Pasta

## Ingredients
* 500g (1 lb) bucatini
* Salt

## For the condimento:
* 1 onion, finely chopped
* 2 fennel bulbs, just the stems and fronds
* 4-6 anchovy fillets
* 3 or 4 small (4 oz/124g) cans of sardines packed in olive oil
* A handful of raisins soaked in warm water
* A handful of pine nuts
* A few threads of saffron, soaked in warm water
* Olive oil
* Salt

## For the topping (optional):

* 100g (1 cup) breadcrumbs
* Olive oil

## Directions
1. Boil the fennel stems and fronds in large pot of well salted water until tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer the fennel out of the pot with a slotted spoon, drain in a colander and let cool. Then chop the fennel and set aside for later use. (NB: Do not discard the cooking water!)

1. While the fennel is cooking, sauté the breadcrumbs in olive oil over gentle heat, stirring so the breadcrumbs are all coated in the oil, until they turn a golden brown. Turn off the heat and set aside until needed.

1. In a large sauté pan or braiser, sauté the onions in olive oil until they are translucent. Add the anchovies and let them melt into the onions. Then mix in the chopped fennel and sauté for a minute or two. Then add the saffron with its liquid, along with the raisins and pine nuts. Simmer everything for a minute or two longer to let the flavors meld. Taste and season with salt if it needs it. Finally, add the sardines and give everything a gentle stir, letting the sardine fillets break up but not disintegrate. Lower the heat as far as it will go to keep this condimento warm.

1. Meanwhile, add the bucatini to the same pot where you had boiled the fennel. Cook until al dente.

1. When the pasta has cooked, transfer it to the pan with the condimento and toss everything together gently.

1. Serve, topped with a sprinkling of the breadcrumbs.
