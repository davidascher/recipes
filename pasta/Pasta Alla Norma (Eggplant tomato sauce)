Ingredients

150 g dried spaghetti
350 g crushed or diced tomatoes
1 small eggplant, sliced
25 g ricotta salata, shaved
1 clove garlic, peeled and thinly diced or mashed
2 cups extra-virgin olive oil
salt & ground black pepper
a few basil leaves, sliced (optional)
lots of paper towel!
Preparation

Lay the eggplant slices on absorbent paper, sprinkle them generously with salt (fig. 1-3).

Let them rest for at least 15 minutes to draw out some moisture through osmosis (fig. 4).
Wash each slice under running cold water to remove the excess salt, then vigorously squeeze the slices to eliminate even more water (which has a hint of bitterness) and to collapse some of the air pockets that constitute the eggplant's spongy structure (so that less oil will be absorbed when deep fried).
Dry the eggplant slices with paper towel, then dice them into uniform cubes (fig. 5).

In a tall pot, pre-heat the olive oil to 150 Â°C; deep fry the eggplant dices (fig. 6) for about 5 minutes until golden, then drain and lay them on paper towel (fig. 7); pat them with more paper towel to soak up any excess oil.

In a large non-stick pan, fry the garlic in 1 tablespoon of olive oil (fig. 8), then add the tomatoes (fig. 9) and the fried eggplant (fig. 10). Simmer for about 15 minutes, adjusting the salt.
Meanwhile, boil the pasta in plenty of salted water then drain it briefly and toss it in the pan with the sauce.
Serve with a generous sprinkle of shaved ricotta salata, the (optional) basil, and some black pepper.
