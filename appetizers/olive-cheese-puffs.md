force build

## Ingredients

* 1c grated cheddar
* 3 Tbsp soft butter
* 24-48 pimento-stuffed olives
* 1/2 c flour
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp paprika

## Steps

* Blend 1 cup grated cheddar with 3 tablespoons soft butter. 
* Stir in 1/2 cup flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon paprika.  Note: Will be very dry and crumbly.
* Thoroughly dry 24-48 pimento stuffed olives \(depending on size\). 
* Wrap approximately 1 teaspoon cheese dough around each olive, covering completely. 
* Put crumbly dough in palm of hand and mash with your thumb - it will cohere with body heat. Then wrap around olive.

Note: can be frozen for up to 1 week.

* Bake at 400 for 10 minutes, until golden.

This takes longer to do than you might think.
