Ingredients

* 3/4 pounds \(3 sticks\) unsalted butter
* 3 cups uncooked rolled oats \(don't use instant\)
* 1 1/2 Tbsp all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 3/4c sugar
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 2 large eggs, lightly beaten

Steps:

* heat oven to 325F.  Cover a baking sheet w/ parchment paper
* In a large saucepan over low heat, melt the butter.  Let cool a bit and add all remaining ingredients except the eggs.  Stir well to combine, then add the eggs.  Mix until thoroughly incorporated
* Place 1 1/2 tsp of batter at a time on the parchment, leaving at least 3 inches in between cookies.  Flatten batter into a circle w/ a back of a spoon \(DA: not needed\).  Bake for 13-15 minutes, or until just golden brown.  Cool on wire racks \(DA: don't, they're too soft -- cool on counter\)
