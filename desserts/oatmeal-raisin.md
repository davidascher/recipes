# Ingredients

* 1 cup (227 g) butter, room temperature
* 2 1/2 cups (375 g) brown sugar
* 2 eggs 
* 1 tsp vanilla 
* 2 1/2 cups (300 g) whole wheat, spelt, or other whole grain flour
* 1 tsp baking powder 
* 1 tsp baking soda 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 2 1/4 cup (240 g) rolled oats 
* 1 1/2 cup (205 g) raisins

# Steps

1. preheat oven to 350F
2. In a standing mixer with a paddle attachment or with an electric hand mixer, cream butter and brown sugar very well together until light and fluffy, we recommend even up to 15 minutes. Add vanilla and eggs one at a time, mixing until completely combined after each addition. 
3. Add all of the dry ingredients except the oats and the raisins and mix until incorporated. Add the oats and raisins last and mix until it is just combined. 
4. Roll into balls roughly 3.5 oz in weight or 1/4 cup for a large cookie or 2.5 oz for a medium sized cookie. Place on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake for approximately 12 minutes until the edges are set and the cookies have turned a dark golden colour.
5. These cookies can also be baked from frozen. Once the cookie dough has been rolled into balls, place them on a tray and freeze. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350Â°F and transfer the frozen cookies onto a parchment lined tray and bake for 15 minutes or until the edges are set.
